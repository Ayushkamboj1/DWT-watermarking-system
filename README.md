# DWT-watermarking-system
This application is a desktop tool for embedding invisible watermarks into images using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to hide a watermark within a host image, making it imperceptible to the human eye while being robust enough for copyright protection.
